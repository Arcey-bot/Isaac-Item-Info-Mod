return {title = "Meat Cleaver", id = 631, description = {'If the enemy normally has a mechanic that splits it (e.g. Teratoma, Envy) then Meat Cleaver will deal a lot of damage and trigger the splitting effect', 'For enemies that have multiple parts to them (e.g. Larry Jr.) it will split them into 2 smaller enemies with half the number of sections they used to have', 'When used, the Meat Cleaver will split all enemies in the room into 2 smaller versions with ~40% health each', 'If the split enemy has low enough health, it will just die instead of splitting', "Doesn't work on end-game bosses except Delirium, where it will deal a chunk of damage and spawn a 2nd Delirium to deal with"}}

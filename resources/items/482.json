{"title": "Clicker", "id": 482, "description": ["When used, this item will randomly change you into another character and remove the last item you picked up", "All stat changes of the new character are applied (e.g. character damage multipliers)", "This item can only reduce your heart containers and will not increase them if you change back into a character with more health. This means if you roll into The Lost, changing back to another character will leave you with only 1/2 of a soul heart", "Cannot turn you into a character that isn't unlocked yet", "Also includes Lazarus II (Lazarus' revived form) and Dark Judas (effect of Judas' Shadow)", "It's also possible that this item will pick the same character, making it seem like nothing happened"]}

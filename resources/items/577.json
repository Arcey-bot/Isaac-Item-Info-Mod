{"title": "Damocles", "id": 577, "description": ["When used, places a sword directly above Isaac's head and while active, will spawn an extra item for every item pedestal spawned", "After getting hit once with the item activated, at any time without warning, the sword may fall, instantly killing Isaac regardless of his health", "After being hit the sword has a 1/10000 chance every 4 frames to fall. This chance doesnt change if you take further damage", "You effectively have a 4.4% chance for every minute that passes after taking damage to die", "Self-inflicted damage i.e. Curse Rooms and Blood Donation Machines don't trigger this effect", "Items with a price will spawn the extra item free of charge (i.e. in shops or devil rooms)", "The only way to survive the falling sword is either through extra lives, by using items that would make you invincible, such as Gnawed Leaf or playing as The Lost. After the sword falls, extra items will no longer spawn"]}

{"title": "Lil Gurdy", "id": 384, "description": ["Gives Isaac a familiar Gurdy that will charge around the room dealing contact damage to enemies", "The Gurdy is charged by holding down the fire button and letting go. The longer the button is held the faster Gurdy will fling itself across the screen", "Lil Gurdy can glide over the top of objects and obstacles in the room", "At full charge Lil Gurdy deals 6 damage per tick while in contact with an enemy", "REPENTANCE - Lil Gurdy can deal significantly more damage (dependent on charge), and now bounces off of enemies and obstacles."]}

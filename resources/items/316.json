If you get hit while Cursed eye is a solid black colour you are guaranteed to be teleported to another random room on the floor. If you get hit in either of the other 2 states you will not be teleported", "The Black Candle item will remove the Cursed Eye's teleportation effect", "REPENTANCE - Burst now has 5 shots instead of 4"]}
